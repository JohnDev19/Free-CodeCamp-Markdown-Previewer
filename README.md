# Markdown Previewer

## Project Overview

- 
## User Stories

This project fulfills the following user stories:

1. I can see a `textarea` element with a corresponding `id="editor"`.
2. I can see an element with a corresponding `id="preview"`.
3. When I enter text into the `#editor` element, the `#preview` element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.
4. When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the `#editor` element, the text is rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element as I type.
5. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the `#editor` field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a sub heading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
6. When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the `#editor` field should be rendered as HTML in the `#preview` element.
